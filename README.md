# Siri Be Gone

A macOS utility to disable Siri and related telemetry services for enhanced privacy.

## üöÄ Overview

`siri-be-gone` is a command-line tool that allows you to disable Siri and various analytics services on your Mac. It offers two modes of operation:

- **Safe Mode**: Disables only non-essential Siri and analytics services
- **Nuke Mode**: Disables all possible services (may affect some functionality)

And when you want Siri back, there's a companion script to restore everything.

## üìã Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or newer
- Administrator privileges (for disabling system services)

## üîß Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the scripts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/siri-be-gone.git
cd siri-be-gone
```

2. Make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x siri_be_gone.sh
chmod +x siri_come_back.sh
```

## üîç Usage

### Disabling Siri and Analytics

To disable Siri and related services, use the `siri_be_gone.sh` script with one of the following options:

```bash
# Safe mode - disables only non-essential services
./siri_be_gone.sh --disable-type safe

# Nuke mode - disables all possible services
